# 0019-caesars-cipher-in-js

I impletented Caesars Cipher in JS and in C aswell.  
Nothing much to say, it is a fun little shifter ;)  


- I made the Caesars Cipher in JS while learning on **freeCodeCamp**
- I made the Caesars Cipher in C while studying for **CS50** HARVARD COURSE
- It was fun to encrypt and decrypt ROME communications haha!
